### **Predicting University GPA from SAT Scores**

A university has recently redefined its success metrics, aiming for 70% of its graduates to achieve high GPAs upon completing their studies.

While it's understood that many factors beyond SAT scores can influence a student's GPA (for example, a student may have a lower SAT score but could show exceptional improvement through dedication and hard work), the task at hand is to build a model based on SAT scores. This model will help the university predict which prospective students are likely to achieve high GPAs, potentially boosting the university's ranking.

For this purpose, the **coefficient** and **intercept** of the model will be derived, enabling the university to identify candidates who are more likely to perform well academically, based on their SAT performance.
